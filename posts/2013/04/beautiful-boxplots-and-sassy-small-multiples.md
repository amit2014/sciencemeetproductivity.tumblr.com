Beautiful boxplots and sassy small multiples
============================================

Last week, I
[posted](http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/post/47682463203/implementing-graphic-design-principles-in-pythons)
about implementing design principles in Pythonâ€™s graphic library,
matplotlib. I received lots of great feedback, and made another
tutorial, specifically about boxplots and [*"small
multiples"*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_multiple). Small
multiples are a concept coined by Edward Tufte about having many plots
using the exact same axes, allowing the reader to discover patterns by
eye, though here I also add linear regression to aid the eye.
