You can code, too!
==================

Recently, I’ve had several conversations with biologists who know they
should probably learn to code, but the whole concept is so daunting and
they’re too busy with their research anyway. I’ve tried to convince them
to pursue programming, not just because it’ll make their research
analyses faster and better, but because it’s an incredibly powerful
skill that anyone can learn.

I see programming and engineering as just other methods of creating
things that never were, like writing or art or music or dance. Before
[Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper), there were no
compilers for computers, and everything had to be written in machine-
and architecture-specific instructions. Before [Donald
Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/) (also see his [advice
for young people video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ju0eM5T2c)),
typesetting math equations was a huge pain, and now we have
[TeX](http://www.tug.org/texlive/),
[LaTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and derivatives to
painlessly create beautiful equations. Before [Linus
Torvalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) and [Richard
Stallman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman), creators of
[GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html) (this is the
operating systema upon which Mac OS is built), there was no unifying
operating system that could be modified and changed for each user’s
needs. Before Microsoft and Apple computer, the concept of the personal
computer didn’t even exist, and it was thought to be just a fad that
wouldn’t hold.

The reason I got into programming wasn’t to make games or to hack into
things. I started because I was working in a biology lab on protein
binding microarrays, and I ran a graduate student’s code which turned
this glass slide with polka dots of where proteins bound to
double-stranded DNA, into the information of the letters bound by this
protein. Then, I took my first programming class in my sophomore year of
college, and I only took it because it was required for Biological
Engineering. It was in [Python](http://www.python.org/). I thought it
was pretty cool, but the moment where I truly became a computational
biologist was my second research experience where I coded up [Hidden
Markov
Models](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n10/full/nbt1004-1315.html)
in Python. The lab I was working in was a C-language lab so I decided to
learn C and “translate” my program from Python to C. It was awesome. As
much as `malloc` and `free` were annoying (though `valgrind` helped!),
it was so satisfying to see my program run 100x faster in C, and have
the satisfaction that I learned this difficult language. Keep in mind
that I had been coding for less than a year when I attempted this
project.

When I did my [MS in bioinformatics](http://bme.soe.ucsc.edu/) at
[UC-Santa Cruz](http://www.ucsc.edu/), I met Paola. She had studied
biochemistry at [UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu/) and came to UCSC for the
program’s bimolecular side, since it technically was *biomolecular
engineering and* bioinformatics. The first class we took for the program
was a bioinformatics algorithms course, and this was the first time she
had coded in her life. And she did *awesome.* She fell in love with
coding as I had, and left gel electrophoresis behind to take discrete
math courses to boost her CS knowledge. She now works as an engineer at
[Survey Monkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/), getting hired after just
over a year of coding.

Another friend of mine, [Neha](http://www.nehalita.com/) studied
mechanical engineering in undergrad, went into consulting, but hated it.
She applied to [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) twice [but
didn’t get
in](http://nerdneha.tumblr.com/post/48064403230/try-try-again-a-lesson-in-persistence).
She took [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) classes on programming and
applied again, this time getting in. Through three months of intensive
programming and software development at Hacker School, Neha learned more
than many people learn in years. She quickly found a job as a software
engineer at [Rent the Runway](http://www.renttherunway.com/rtr_home) and
adores it.

I’m incredibly proud of Paola and Neha for reinventing themselves. And
the task of learning programming is not impossible, it just takes time
and
[grit](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tedtalks/angela-lee-duckworth-tedtalk_b_4277459.html).
And you can do it, too.

Next time you sit down to analyze some differential expression or
calculate some statistics, force yourself to do it in Python,
specifically [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org). Feel free to tweet at
me with questions! My handle is [@olgabot](https://twitter.com/olgabot)

EDIT:
-----

I forgot to mention that one of my mentors, [Sean
Eddy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Eddy), studied molecular biology
for his PhD, and only after he earned his PhD did he get into coding.
And he’s made significant contributions to the field of computational
biology through the sequence homology comparison program,
[HMMER](http://hmmer.janelia.org/), RNA structure prediction through
[Infernal](http://infernal.janelia.org/). If you can do it after a PhD,
it’s truly never too late!

On the flip side, at both UC-Santa Cruz and UC-San Diego there are
lifelong software engineers who have spent decades coding up programs,
and have decided that they want to apply their programming skills to
something else. So they go do a PhD in bioinformatics! Either way, from
biology to coding, or from coding to biology, you end up in
bioinformatics! Clearly the best field :)

### Resources for learning to code

-   [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) (like a “code-academy”… get
    it??): Codecademy is an awesome resource for getting started with a
    language. I used it to learn Javascript!
-   [Rosalind.info](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/): Named
    after Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography experiments
    helped Watson and Crick discover that DNA is a double helix,
    Rosalind.info is an awesome resource for bioinformatics-specific
    problems. You start with translating DNA to RNA to Protein, then
    eventually you build your own genome assembler!
-   [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1): Cool
    way to start learning code versioning (keeping backups of your
    code), which is ultra-important so you don’t have to try to remember
    what you did six months ago.
-   [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/): An online learning platform
    with tons of classes, including the awesome (Bioinformatics
    Algorithms)[https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics] class
    that I helped design. I’ve also taken the [Probabalistic Graphical
    Models](https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm) and [Machine
    Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) courses. PGMs was
    good, but ML was a little watered down for my math major self, but
    it’s a good intro overall.
-   [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/): Another online learning
    platform. They have tons of courses on [Computer
    Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101), [Web
    Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253), [Design of
    Computer Programs](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs212) (taught by
    [Peter Norvig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig)!!!), and
    many, many, more.
