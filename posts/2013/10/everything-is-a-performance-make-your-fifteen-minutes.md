Everything is a performance: Make your fifteen minutes count
============================================================

Musicians, actors, dancers, and other performers know how much
preparation and practice goes into their few minutes (or a few hours) of
actual performing. Consider a single dancer in a 1.5 hour performance. A
professional 25-year-old dancer has probably been dancing since they
were around 5, and they’ve logged thousands of hours practicing dance,
and probably another few hundred preparing for this single performance.
Before they learned the dance, the choreographer, who has also probably
been dancing for the same amount of time, but has spent significant
amount practicing coming up with new choreography, spent tens if not
hundreds of hours coming with the choreography to be taught for this
performance.

Same with scientists - hours of work and preparation go into just the
technical aspects of a manuscript, grant, or technical presentation, and
even more time goes into editing, wordsmithing, and perfecting the
delivery. But here the performance is the text, which must stand alone
for all eternity as the written manifestation of this work.

Why do we spend so much time before the actual performance? Because it’s
only the performance that people see and remember. If they see an
uninspired performance of dull choreography, they’ll remember that and
not want to see that show/dancers/choreographer again. If they see a
crappy paper, they’ll remember the authors and know not to take their
work too seriously in the future. And, in my case, if they see a crappy
fellowship application, they’ll toss it out.
