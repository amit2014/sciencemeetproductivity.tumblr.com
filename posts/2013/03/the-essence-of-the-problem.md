The essence of the problem
==========================

In one of my classes, the main project is to formulate a biological
problem as a computational problem. This formulation should be such that
you can give your computational problem formulation to a “genius
computer science slave” (aka you are the slave, and hopefully the genius
will come) and they could come up with an algorithm to solve it.

I’m really excited about my problem formulation, which is a new method
of sequence assembly, but every time I met with the professor to discuss
my formulation, he wanted me to further simplify the problem. At first,
I was too hung up on the quality of the sequencing reads, the fact that
they are paired-end, etc. My professor prodded me towards a simpler and
simpler formulation, the “essence of the problem.” And at this essence
of the problem, the solution becomes obvious.

This reminds me of my [post about Eric
Lander](http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/post/30674921280/how-to-be-fabulously-successful-eric-lander),
where he talked about “struggling with a problem” in his interview, and
that at some point in the struggle, “the structure of the problem
becomes clear, and the path through it becomes clear.” I couldn’t have
figured out the essence of the problem without the struggle I went
through.

Similarly, I see the “essence” of cello playing as playing these notes,
in this order. I know this is a gross oversimplification, but this what
[my cello teacher](http://www.celloloft.com/) prescribes as the first
step in learning a new piece. And I agree with him - if you’re not
comfortable playing these notes in this order, no amount of musicality
or phrasing will save you. Once you have these notes down, you can then
add bowings, rhythm, phrasing, etc to create a beautiful piece. Maybe
the phrasing and performance just falls into place because of the order
and rhythm of the notes. But you had to start at the essence first.
