3 boring ways to be productive
==============================

What do President Obama and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg have in common?
They both wear basically the
[same](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama)
[outfit](http://www.quora.com/Mark-Zuckerberg-1/Why-does-Mark-Zuckerberg-always-wear-the-same-shirt)
every day. When asked why, both have similar answers, “it’s one less
decision I have to make in a day.” [1,2]

[Studies](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/74/5/1252/)
[have](http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183591)
[shown](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/94/5/883/) that making
decisions, even tiny ones, deplete your mental energy for the more
important ones [3,4,5]. Even choosing between candy bars takes away from
the energy you could have used to solve a crucial problem!

To put as much of my non-career life on autopilot, here are three habits
I’ve formed that help me increase my productivity.

No. 1: Pick out your clothes and pack your bag the night before
===============================================================

To follow Obama and Zuckerburg, don’t waste your energy on picking what
you put on your body. What matters is that it’s appropriate and that
you’re clothed.

Yes, this is something a parent would say to their child, but it works!
By the end of the day my brain is usually pretty drained, but doing
something semi-mindless like putting my keys and wallet back into my bag
is usually fine. I check the weather for the next day and asses my
outfit situation. In the morning, I don’t want to be wasting my time
thinking about whether my bag is ready or not — I want to *go!*

In Southern California, this is usually “short sleeves or long?” But
when I was in school in Boston, checking tomorrow’s weather answered the
more serious question of whether I needed snow boots or not.

No. 2: Exercise (almost) every day, at the same time
====================================================

While I’m a morning person, exercising in the morning was completely
repulsive to me! That’s when my mind is the most fresh and when I can
accomplish the most. Exercising in the morning is my body stealing time
away from my mind. Until I realized I could work both my mind *and* body
in the morning! The author of [this blog
post](http://joel.is/post/24064139389/the-exercise-habit) wakes up at
5:50am, works for an hour, then goes to the gym 7am-8am, then comes
home, has breakfast, and goes on with his day. (Obama)[] also touts the
virtues of daily exercise.

I experimented with this schedule of waking up, working, exercising,
then getting on with the day. The difference in productivity on the days
I worked out and the days I didn’t was amazing. The days I worked out,
I’d get almost 6 hours of serious mental work in. When I didn’t, I’d
only truly work for about three hours.

So I decided to keep doing this, and now I’m waking up at 4:50am every
weekday, working, then exercising 6am-7am (I started
[Insanity](http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do)
two weeks ago), then getting ready and off for my day. I hate rushed
mornings and it takes me about an hour and a half to eat, make lunch,
and get ready, but I’m still in the process of optimizing and
parallel-processing my mornings. I’m aiming to get it under an hour,
then under 45 minutes so I can catch my bus and get to lab before 8:15.

It’s important to keep your exercise at the same time every day because
your body gets used to when it gets physically taxed. It’s also been
shown that people who exercise in the morning stick to daily workouts
for longer.

No. 3: Minimize your decisions about food
=========================================

Fortunately for me, I’m getting paid less than \$30K a year as a
graduate student so I can’t afford to go out for meals every day. So I
don’t have to choose what to eat at lunch every day because it’s already
been figured out for me.

I love cooking, but I despise cooking every day because I think it’s a
waste of time. Last year at Univ. Calif. - Santa Cruz, I would make a
large batch of a fried rice or pasta dish each week, and then take those
leftovers to lunch with me. I’ve been doing the same thing here at
UC-San Diego. Check out this picture from my fridge:

![Olga's
refrigerator](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EuMSvyu7ySM/UGfFd_Ph8aI/AAAAAAAAI1Y/AyzZB7zNJm0/s1223/IMAG0056.jpg)

Yes, my shelf of the fridge is quite stuffed. I went to
[Costco](http://www.costco.com/) today and got a bunch of food. I’ve
annotated the photo, and here are some further details:

-   **Breakfast:** I have an amazing [rice
    cooker](http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NS-LAC05XA-Uncooked-Cooker-Stainless/dp/B000G30ESY)
    that has a “porridge” setting and a timer. At night, I pour in my
    1/4 cup oatmeal, 1/4 sweetened vanilla almond milk, tablespoon of
    coconut milk, splash of vanilla (I really like vanilla), some salt,
    and 1/2 cup water into the rice cooker and set the timer for 7am.
    When I’m done working out and showering, my food is ready! I also
    add in a banana, which I cut into the bowl with a spoon, and some
    walnuts. Very filling.
-   **Lunch:** This week I made a very spicy and delicious ground beef
    fried rice that was a combination of these
    [two](http://chinesefood.about.com/od/ricefried/r/Ground-Beef-Fried-Rice-Recipe.htm)
    [recipes](http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-ground-beef-fried-rice-150499).
    I marinated the beef in soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chili oil,
    salt, black pepper, and white pepper, for about 15 or so minutes in
    the fridge. Then I fried that up in a dutch oven, though I should
    have fried the chopped onion first. Then added 2 square inches of
    grated ginger, a whole head of minced garlic, and a tablespoon each
    of red pepper flakes and cayenne powder. Then came the vegetables -
    about four cups of frozen Normandy Mix vegetables from Costco, a cup
    of frozen peas, and a can of baby corn. While the vegetables were
    cooking, I scrambled eight (8) eggs with salt, pepper, and toasted
    sesame oil, and added that to the mix. Then I added three cups of
    brown rice and mixed it all together. Turned out quite well! Then I
    packed the food into several glass tupperware containers.
-   **Post-lunch:** I like having snacks around but I want them to be
    pre-portioned out for me. That’s probably why the 100-calorie packs
    have taken off so well. Costco has gigantic bags of baby carrots,
    sugar snap peas, and broccoli florets that I packed into individual
    snack packs. This is great because when I pack my lunch bag in the
    morning, I know that I just need to grab a tupperware and a veggie
    bag and I’m set.
-   **Dinner:** I don’t like eating a lot at night because it makes me
    feel nauseous when I lie down if I’m full. Using [America’s Test
    Kitchen’s cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933615486/) (highly
    recommended, especially for less-experienced cooks because their
    explanations are fabulous) as a guideline, I make a salad for dinner
    just about every night. My favorite is the “Herb Salad” mix from
    Trader Joe’s, a handful of blueberries, 1/4 cup of freshly-toasted
    almonds (I just toast them in a dry skillet), several strips of
    parmesan shaved with a vegetable peeler, and some home made balsamic
    dressing.
-   **Dessert:** It’s good to indulge. I adore the sweet/salty mix, so
    there’s some dark chocolate with carmel and sea salt not pictured in
    the freezer (so it doesn’t get too gooey). Other times I’ll have
    greek yogurt with honey and blueberries. But I don’t always feel
    like dessert.
