Arianna Huffington on sleep. She also reminds us to not glamorize exhaustion! I&#8217;m posting this at ~9pm as I&#8217;m about to go to sleep. On that note, if you&#8217;re looking at a computer screen late into the night, you should install f.lux which will reduce the blue light your computer emits so you rest better.
