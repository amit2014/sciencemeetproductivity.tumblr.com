How to use Google's internet caching to your advantage
======================================================

You’ve run into this problem: you search for something on the supposedly
all-powerful Google search, click the link, but it’s dead. Nothing’s
there. Not even a speck of information.

But Google said there was!

I ran into this exact problem for an assignment this week. We were
supposed to use the Disordered Protein database
[DisProt](http://www.disprot.org) and use the
[PONDR-FIT](http://www.disprot.org/pondr-fit.php) algorithm to find a
protein that is predicted to be disordered, but is not in the DisProt
database. However, the DisProt servers went down as of noon yesterday.
With the assignment due today, what are we to do? Well, the due date was
pushed back but I figured out how to search Disprot even though it was
down, and learned a bit about Google’s [internet
caching](http://www.googleguide.com/cached_pages.html) (aka their plan
to save all the knowledge ever publicly posted to the web.) in the
process.

Viewing cached pages: step-by-step
----------------------------------

1.  Do a Google search as usual
2.  Hover your cursor over the result you want, and you should see two
    arrowheads pointing to the right: » Click on them.
3.  A preview of your page should appear on the right.

Below is an example:

pages](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdicicTCHG1rw6gvj.png)

Turn on “Verbatim” mode to narrow your results
----------------------------------------------

But what if you need to validate negative results, as we did for our
assignment? Use “Verbatim” mode, which will stop auto-correcting your
spelling to get you more result hits.

### Without “Verbatim” mode

Without “Verbatim” mode, my “disprot oct4” query gets mangled to
“disport oct4” and I get lyrics for some weird band I’ve never heard of.

To turn on “Verbatim” mode:

1.  Do a Google search as usual
2.  Click “Search Tools” in the bar below the search box
3.  Click “All results” (you want to filter so you *don’t* get all
    results)
4.  Click “Verbatim”

A visual tutorial is here:

### With “Verbatim” mode

With “Verbatim” mode on, I get totally weird results which means that
“oct4” is indeed nowhere to be found on DisProt!
