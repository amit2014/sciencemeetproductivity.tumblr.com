Most of the time, you fail
==========================

This year, I only applied to two fellowships:
[Hertz](http://www.hertzfoundation.org/) and [Paul and Daisy
Soros](http://www.pdsoros.org/). And I didn’t even get to the interview
stage of either of them. But I’m gonna keep on trucking. After all, it’s
[grit and determination that lead to
success](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/ted-talks-education/speaker/dr-angela-lee-duckworth/).
So I’ll have a lot more failures before I get to the success, but that’s
okay.
